# HOSTR  
### AI-Powered Event Management Platform

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://hostr-ai.vercel.app/

HOSTR is a **full-stack AI-powered event management platform** that enables users to create, manage, promote, and run events end-to-end — from a **single AI prompt** to **QR-based ticketing and check-ins**.

This project is built to demonstrate **real-world product thinking**, **scalable frontend architecture**, and **production-ready full-stack engineering skills**.

Traditional event platforms are:
- Time-consuming to set up  
- Fragmented across tools  
- Not optimized for creators and communities  

**HOSTR simplifies the entire lifecycle of an event using AI + modern UX + full-stack engineering.**
